 What: module ui router could not be found;
 Steps: looked at index.html to make sure that it was being brought in.
        found that a wicket was missing on line 31. fixed and still had the same
        error. looked at my current project with ui router and compared it with app.js
        saw that  ui router had a dash : ['ui-router'], instead of a dot: ['ui.router'].

Fix: added a ">" on index.html
      changed "-" to "."


What: unexpected end of input on productsCtrl line 9
Steps:
looked at productsCtrl line 9
productsCtrl was missing an '}' on line 9;
Fix: added "}"

added an '=' between ngApp and 'miniRouting'



line 31 on the index.html was missing an '>'

the app.js file was just passing a string instead of a string and an object :

// app.js things were  like:
        .state('dashboard') {
        templateUrl: './views/dashboard.html',
        url: '/dashboard/',
        controller: 'dashCtrl'
        })

        when they should've been like:

        .state('dashboard', {
        templateUrl: './views/dashboard.html',
        url: '/dashboard/',
        controller: 'dashCtrl'
        })


app.js- moved a }) from line 16 to line 22

product service not injected into controller





on app.js  had settingsctrl instead of settingsCtrl
