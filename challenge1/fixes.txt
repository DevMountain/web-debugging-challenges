Placed missing } on line 9 of js/products/productsCtrl.js

Replaced parans that were placed incorrectly on the states js/app.js

Placed missing equal sign on html
from ng-app'miniRouting' to ng-app='miniRouting'

angular ui router was injected incorrectly in App.js Changed ['ui-router'])
 to ['ui.router'])

Added  $urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/') to routes. Good practice for error handling

Incorrect CDN link was used for script tag src for ui.routing. Replaced with proper CDN:
    <script src="http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/release/angular-ui-router.js"></script>

Capitalized C in "controller: 'settingsCtrl'" in line 13 of App.js

Injected productService into productsCtrl.js
  angular.module('miniRouting').controller("productsCtrl", function($scope, $stateParams, productService)...

Removed 's' from ui-sref product link in index.html
