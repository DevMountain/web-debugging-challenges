Bug1: Missing } on productsCtrl.js line 9.  Looked at console, and saw the location of the error and added }.
Bug2: Missing > tag on ui-router script tag.  I noticed that the </script> tag was the wrong color and looked through
the line to find the error.
Bug3: Improper Syntax on app.js page. I googled stateProvider to see the proper syntax and discovered the state name
should have a comma then a curly bracket followed by the state details.  The config portion was also missing its closing brackets
