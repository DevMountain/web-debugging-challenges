bug: miniRouting is not available
    fix: i found that  the closing script tag for the ui router was not there and needed to say
    ui.router in the app.js file instead of ui-router

bug: at each state in app.js file there was an unexpected token "{"
    fix: i saw that it needed to be inside the parenthasis and then closed at the end.
    i also found an extra set of closing ')}' which was causing issues.

bug: productsCtrl.js:9 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )
    fix needed a closing "}" right befor that token
