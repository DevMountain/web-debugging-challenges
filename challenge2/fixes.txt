Upon firing up server.js it displays 'Cannot find module "cors"' I'll look into the application of the file and
to see if it's in the package.json file.
After npm installing the packages. all errors have disappeared. Looks clean but haven't
checked postman.


Syntax Errors:
In server.js file on line 20:36 fixed spelling error for endpoint from 'raed' to 'read';
