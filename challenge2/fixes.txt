1. On line 20 of server.js, instead of reverencing the read method, it said raed. (When referencing a method created from another file, you must use the exact spelling)

2. In the SightingCtrl, it's sending back the error when it should be doing result vice versa - It appears this way on all 4 methods (If no errors, should send back the result of the post)

3. Similar to last one, it should send back 200 if successful not 500 (send back correct number things like 200 or 500 statuses)

4. Changed all 500 to 200 (correct status)

5. Took out the frickin ! before the errors with the error handling part in SightingCtrl, instead of !err now its err (!makes it if there is no error, but i was checking that there was)


no errors in terminal or actual console left
