- looked at error in terminal from nodemon. Looked through package.json. Realized there are no
  nodemodules. npm install for fix

- read through error. /Users/Dan/DevMountain/web-debugging-challenges/challenge2/controllers/SightingCtrl.js:23:25
  checked sightingctrl line 23. added a return to line 21 for fix. Did the same for the error response on the other
  crud operations to prevent this error for each.
