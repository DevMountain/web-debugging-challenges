template names were incorrect in the file paths in app.js. Changed to correct naming.

shoeData was misspelled in the productCtrl. I wasl ooking there fora seperate issue and found that.


the product state couldnt be resolved, so I checked what state it was trying to load. There was an s missing from the ui-sref for the products.

the data in the service was labeled with variables instead of this. it wasn't bringing data in and that's where the flow took me.

The url for products had productid instead of just id being passed in. The routing was failing when switching between the two routes so I checked what was being passed into the url.

all links work and data populates appropriately.
