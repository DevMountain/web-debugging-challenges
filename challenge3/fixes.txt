Fixed routes in app.js. All 3 routes had template spelled out when file name had abbreviation tmpl.
 ex: templateUrl: 'js/settings/settingsTemplate.html' => templateUrl: 'js/settings/settingsTmpl.html'

Line 17 of app.js products route was setup to look for a param called productsid, but ui-sref link on
index.html param was set to id. Changed param in route to match
id.
 url: '/products/:productid' => url: '/products/:id'

There's a duplicate of <script src="js/app.js"></script> on index.html. Removed one

Added 's' from ui-sref product link in index.html to be consistent with naming of productsCtrl,
  and productsService
