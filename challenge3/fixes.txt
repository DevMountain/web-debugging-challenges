Syntax Errors:

In "js/app.js" all .state templateUrls were misspelled. Felt the easiest fix was
to just change the spelling from homeTemplate.html to match the actual file name in reference.

After the fixes only error from routing is unable to resolve 'product from state''. Let's have a look:
product.html is fine.
Oh my goodness it was a simple misspelling of "products" instead of "product" in 'js/app.js' line 16:25.
 All clear in console. On to the last one.
Also needed to match the StateParam to jus '/":id"' in app.js
