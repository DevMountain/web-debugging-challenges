Page is not loading. Which means a function in the code.js file is on a infinite loop. Gonna throw some of them in Repl.it to
see what the issue is.

"while(arr.length >= 0){""  will an infinite loop because it will always be larger than 0. it only needed to loop until our new array was the same length as the initial array
Also the second argument of the slice method needed to be the index after the random number.
